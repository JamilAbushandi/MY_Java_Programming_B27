public interface Pictures {
    /*
    Pictures Interface

• Create hasPictures interface and declare the following actions:

 - likePicture()
 - unLikePicture()
 - sharePicture()

• Implement this interface to the Instagram class. (The actual implementation
does not matter. Print statement related to action. Focus on idea of how
abstraction is working)


Extra: Make a bunch of objects and try different things out

- Create an ArrayList of Social Media objects to store both
Facebook and Instagram objects

- Find all the Facebook objects that had less than 5000 friends to
they could be added

- Go through all the Instagram objects and like a picture from each
object

- Check which user has both Instagram and Facebook object by
comparing their full names
